## Problem

All Telegram bots are public. So anyone can harm your development server or fetch sensitive information.

## Solution

You cannot hide your bot from Telegram search, but you can create a whitelist of developers who will have access to it. Everyone else will receive an unauthorized message.

## Files
`index.js` -  contains pseudocode with an example.<br>
`.env.example` - .env example
